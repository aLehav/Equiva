        Our Mission at Equiva is to match consumers with the most environmentally conscientious and
        sustainable items. So that you can feel good about your purchase, and the planet can too! 
        We filter and sort the best options in terms of reduced carbon footprint, material sourcing, 
        manufacturing ethics, and more. With each purchase made using Equiva, a donation is delivered 
        to a corresponding charity, be it a dog shelter or an effort to replant trees.
